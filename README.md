# GitHub Style Override

Tiny Chrome extension to revert GitHub.com's font back to Helvetica. The changed it to mimic a "system default" font in July of 2016.

This includes a bonus features where it sets tabs on GitHub.com to equal whatever number of spaces you want (default: 4). GitHub defaults to 8 which is pretty silly, I think.

## Install

Installing is easy. Just download this repository, unzip it, and click "load unpacked extension" in Google Chrome, and select the `github-style-override-chrome` directory you just downloaded. See [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) for step-by-step instructions on installing an unpacked extension.

## Notes

1. This is meant for Chrome running on Mac. Windows probably won't work (and won't show Helvetica unless you bought it.)
2. I'll keep this updated indefinitely. GitHub on Mac+Chrome comprises a large part of my daily career activities and I can't look at [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) all day.
3. Feel free to contribute.
